To run the demo, run the main scene as one would normally run a godot project. Currently the scene 
consists of a player, a world (ground, cacti, and food) and a camera through which the player 
observes the world. The player (big gray rectangle) can currently move forward with the w key. the 
camera can be rotated by moving the mouse. In the future, the player's movement capabilities will be 
expanded with a double jump and swimming ability. The camera will be altered to trach the player. 
The food will become collectible and the cacus will hurt the player. These will be visible through 
an on screen GUI.
